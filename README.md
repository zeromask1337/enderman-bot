# Enderman bot version 1.0

Created with love. Took a lot of time, despite its smallness. Its not a complete project, but a good start in big, cold telegram bot world.

Bot uses Graham Edgecombi's API to find item id's and command table from wiki.

> Use `/item "itemName"` to find item id's

> Type `/cmd "commandName"` to find command. Click on it, or type its full name with '/' to get full info, like version compability.

```
In future version (not soon) I want to send item pictures with id's, so it will be much easier to differentiate them. Also want to make pop up menu on command enter and inline keyboard.
